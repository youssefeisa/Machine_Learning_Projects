# 🚨 Fraud Detection Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project implements a **machine learning–based fraud detection system** for financial transactions.  
It simulates a real-world scenario by covering **data analysis, model training, and deployment** in one complete pipeline.

The focus is on **practical application**, not theory.

## 🛠️ What Was Implemented

- 📊 Exploratory data analysis to uncover fraud patterns  
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- 🧠 Feature engineering on transactional data  
- 🤖 Machine learning model for fraud classification  
- 🔗 End-to-end ML pipeline (preprocessing + model)  
- 🌐 Model deployment using a Streamlit interface  

---

## 🎯 Model Goal

Classify each transaction as:
- ✅ Legitimate  
- ❌ Fraudulent  

Based on transaction behavior and balance changes.

## 📌 Features Used

- 🏷️ Transaction type  
- 💸 Transaction amount  
- 🧾 Sender balance before transaction  
- 📉 Sender balance after transaction  
- 🏦 Receiver balance before transaction  
- 📈 Receiver balance after transaction  

---

## 📤 Prediction Output

- `0` → ✅ Legitimate transaction  
- `1` → ❌ Fraudulent transaction
